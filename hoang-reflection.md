# GPS 1.1 Reflection

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

**I struggled with writing a good commit message.**

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

**The guide help identify a few guidelines to a commit message. Git will cut off message at about 80 characters, so it shouldn't be too long. The message should be in present tense. After reflecting on it some more, I will also move forward by asking myself... *If someone else is reading this message, will they understand what was changed since the last commit?* **

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

**I asked what tips can you give me for writing a good commit message.**

* What still confuses you about Git?

**If a git repo was accidentally cloned into an existing git repo, what happens? How do I remedy this problem? Will rm -rf the bad repo fix it?**

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

**I enjoyed the session. I feel my pair and I had an open communication line. The guide layed out what we should expect from him, and he executed his style perfectly.**
